# Python-Finance
S&amp;P 500 || Stock Data Manipulation 

I will be covering back testing, stock screening, reading and writing to excel, porfolio analysis, and more! 

I am a data analyst with a background in economics and skills in Excel, Tableau, Python, and SQL from The University of Texas at Austin. Intellectual curiosity and ability to extract hidden information located within large sets of structured, semi-structured, and raw data. My analytical problem solving capabilities integrated with strengths in collaborating across diverse groups, makes me a valuable addition to any team.
